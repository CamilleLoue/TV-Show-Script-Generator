# Friends of Thrones - A TV show script generated using BART
“Chandler Bing and Tyrion Lannister enter Central Perk and order a pint of ale.” – What do you imagine this conversation to go like? How would Tyrion’s incessant wit deal with Chandler’s constant sarcasm? Sounds like quite an intriguing situation, doesn’t it? It’s hard to imagine even for us as humans, but if we had to train a machine to come up with this conversation, what might that look like?

F.R.I.E.N.D.S and Game of Thrones are two of the most-watched TV shows in the world, each of them belonging to very different genres. This project aims at training a BART model on the scripts of both these shows to see if it can generate new scenes with characters from both the shows.
